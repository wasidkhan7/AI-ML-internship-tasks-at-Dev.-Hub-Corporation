## 📂 Project Breakdown

### 1️⃣ News Classification using BERT Transformer

- **Objective**: Develop a multi-class text classification model that categorizes news articles into one of four categories: `World`, `Business`, `Technology/Science`, and `Sports`.
- **Approach**:
  - Utilized **pre-trained BERT** model from Hugging Face Transformers
  - Fine-tuned on AG News dataset for custom classification
  - Applied tokenization, padding, truncation, and attention masks
- **Results**: Achieved high accuracy and strong generalization using contextual embeddings

### 2️⃣ Customer Churn Prediction with Scikit-learn

- **Objective**: Build an end-to-end **machine learning pipeline** to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on provided tabular features.
- **Steps**:
  - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  - Feature Engineering and One-Hot Encoding
  - Train-Test Split
  - Model Training using **Random Forest / Logistic Regression**
  - Evaluation with metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC
- **Outcome**: Delivered a scalable ML pipeline for churn classification, ready for deployment.

### 3️⃣ Multimodal House Price Prediction (Tabular + Image Data)

- **Objective**: Predict real estate prices by combining structured **tabular data** (e.g., location, area, number of rooms) and **image data** of properties using deep learning.
- **Methodology**:
  - Tabular Processing with Pandas and Scikit-learn
  - Image Processing and Feature Extraction using **CNN (TensorFlow/Keras)**
  - Combined both feature sets for a final prediction using a unified model
- **Result**: Built a multimodal prediction model that improves accuracy over traditional single-input models
