# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction (End-to-End ML Pipeline)

## 🧾 Project Description

This project aims to **predict whether a customer will churn (leave a service)** using a complete **end-to-end machine learning pipeline**. It was part of a two-month internship at Developer Hub Corporation, emphasizing real-world implementation, scalability, and model interpretability.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python, Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

## 🧠 Workflow

1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Encoded categorical features (OneHot/Label Encoding)
   - Normalized numerical features
   - Performed EDA to understand customer behavior patterns

2. **Model Pipeline Creation**
   - Built an ML pipeline with:
     - Preprocessing
     - Feature selection
     - Classification model
   - Tried models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall
   - ROC-AUC Score
   - Confusion Matrix
